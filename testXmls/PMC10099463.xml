                    <title>Objective</title>
                    <p>The objective of this study was to assess the clinical utility of a model of
                        seven principles for effective visiting primary care services and to
                        determine how it could be conceptualised as a tool for evaluation.</p>

                    <p>The research was undertaken in the context of visiting primary care services
                        with an agency, Outback Futures, selected as a case study.</p>

                    <p>Three executive staff with Outback Futures participated in the research.</p>

                    <title>Design</title>
                    <p>The case study design involved data collection by four group interviews
                        conducted between July and November 2021. The interview data were analysed
                        using thematic analysis.</p>

                    <title>Results</title>
                    <p>This case study is additional evidence for the clinical utility of the model
                        of seven principles. The results reinforce the importance of a
                        community&#x02010;focussed approach to assess the impact of visiting service
                        organisations on rural and remote communities. A comprehensive approach to
                        evaluation is required to justify the investments made and safeguard the
                        health and well&#x02010;being of rural and remote residents. A
                        self&#x02010;assessment protocol has been established from the model for use
                        by visiting services. Furthermore, three themes were drawn from the data: <italic

                <sec id="ajr12946-sec-0006">
                    <title>Conclusion</title>
                    <p>The model is appropriate for the case study organisation, and has clinical
                        utility and implications for other visiting services. A
                        self&#x02010;assessment protocol has been developed. Future research should
                        apply the model and protocol self&#x02010;assessment tool in an effort to
                        construct a consistent and credible approach to evaluation of visiting
                        primary care services.</p>

                visiting primary care services in operation, including differences in the type of
                practitioners involved, the organisation's model of service delivery, and the focus
                of interventions (e.g., well&#x02010;being, diabetes, specific injuries or
                illnesses, generalised primary care).<xref rid="ajr12946-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">
                \n<sup>3</sup>\n</xref> Furthermore, literature pertaining to visiting primary care

            <p>Health services based in communities, whether they be metropolitan or rural in

                communities. Models for evaluation of the impact of visiting primary care services
                should account for the contextual nuances of rural and remote communities. The model

                    ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>2</sup>\n</xref> has potential utility for evaluating

                    toggle="yes">Justification</italic> requires visiting service organisations

                establishing itself in a new region with community consultation as a priority. <italic

                the effectiveness and appropriateness of clinical and non&#x02010;clinical aspects
                of the client and community interaction. Review is likely to combine two components:
                a needs analysis of the community and an evaluation of the service provided.<xref
                    rid="ajr12946-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>5</sup>\n</xref> The revised
                model provides visiting services a framework for evaluation; however, it is in need
                of critical appraisal by stakeholders in the field. The objective of the present
                study is to assess the clinical utility of the revised model and to determine how it
                can be conceptualised into a tool for evaluation used by visiting service

            <p>Case study<xref rid="ajr12946-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>6</sup>\n</xref> was
                selected as the method to appraise the model and a visiting primary care
                organisation, Outback Futures (OF), was chosen as the case. Outback Futures is a
                not&#x02010;for&#x02010;profit allied health service based in a capital city,
                Brisbane, Australia. Its team of psychologists, counsellors, speech pathologists,
                occupational therapists and social workers travel to remote and very remote areas of
                Queensland to deliver face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face services. In between visits,
                clinicians meet with clients for regular sessions conducted by telehealth. Outback
                Futures work with clients across the lifespan in a range of formats including
                individual therapy, professional development, and community presentations.</p>
            <p>The research questions guiding the case study were: What is the clinical utility of
                the revised model of seven principles for effective visiting services in the case of
                Outback Futures? And, can the model be conceptualised as a tool for evaluation used
                by visiting primary care services?</p>

                        <p>I think all seven [principles] are really critical&#x02026; We can be
                    measuring clinical outputs and they can be good, but that doesn't mean that
                    we're making any overall change in the whole of community. Our model is about
                    whole of community transformation. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Participant

                    </disp-quote>\n</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the participants reported that each of the seven revised principles
                    held clinical utility for the specific case of Outback Futures, rating them all
                    as either <italic toggle="yes">very</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">extremely
                    important</italic> (ratings 6 and 7). Two amendments were suggested to the
                    definitions of principles Partnership and Review. Regarding Partnership, the
                    participant's reported that it is important for visiting services to consult
                    with community prior to establishing themselves, however, they indicated that
                    the process of forming a healthy and robust partnership involves time and
                    consistency. In the case of Outback Futures, the development of rapport with
                    rural and remote communities occurs over a period of at least 2&#x02009;years.
                    The second suggested amendment was for the definition of Review where the
                    participants requested the inclusion of a strengths analysis of the community,
                    as well as the previously defined needs analysis, to reframe the approach where
                    appropriate.</p>
                <p>The participant's emphasised their perspective that OF is different from other
                    visiting services.<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="ajr12946-blkfxd-0003">
                        <p>I think one of the challenging things is that if you're looking at
                    general visiting services, it's actually quite different to Outback
                    Futures&#x02026; We're one of the few, organisations who offers service
                    provision but is actually focussed on whole of community change&#x02026; A
                    standard visiting service isn't focussed on community engagement and community
                    mapping, they don't have time for that, they don't have funds for that. <named-content

                    \n</p>
                <p>The participants reported that they believed that OF is different from other
                    visiting services because of their long&#x02010;term commitment to community
                    well&#x02010;being. This commitment influences their funding decisions through
                    the diversity of funders, and their workforce structure.<disp-quote
                        content-type="quotation" id="ajr12946-blkfxd-0004">
                        <p>The advantage of our workforce model&#x02026;is the fact that we recruit
                    to a region, so that even when we are not in a community physically, our
                    headspace is in that community&#x02026; It just means we're more accessible
                    and&#x02026; there's much greater consistency and reliability in that. <named-content

                <p>Therefore, while the current study demonstrates clinical utility for the model
                    with the case, the results cannot be completely generalised to all visiting

                <p>The third and fourth interviews were structured to have participants brainstorm
                    potential indicators for the accreditation tool. Each indicator was designed to

                    the model. Preliminary indicators were proposed in the discussion of the group

                <p>Throughout the data collection process, four of the seven principles were
                    identified by the participants as mandatory indicating that they were of
                    particular importance, and the remaining principles were classified instead as

                    that actually as wholes they're all pretty important&#x0201d; (Participant #2).
                    &#x0201c;That was my feeling yesterday when I read through this, I was a bit
                    concerned about only having four of them as mandatory, the others all felt

                <p>As an outcome of the current study, the self&#x02010;assessment tool has been
                    established and produced into a document for use by visiting service
                    organisations. A preview of the output is captured in Figure&#x000a0;<xref
                        rid="ajr12946-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> with the full text available
                    upon request. To use the self&#x02010;assessment measure, visiting service
                    organisations can use each indicator (four or five per principle) and rate their
                    performance on a 6&#x02010;point Likert scale presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref
                        rid="ajr12946-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Totals can be calculated
                    for each Principle to determine if the organisation <italic toggle="yes">requires
                    significant work</italic> on a principle or has rated as <italic toggle="yes">solid
                    work with areas to improve</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">strength with some

                    used to construct the business&#x02010;use document informing both cosmetic and

                    have been incorporated to allow users to fill the form out electronically. These
                    features make regular review more achievable and allow organisations to capture

                        that OF visits. As a result of turnover and inconsistency, community members
                        are sceptical of visiting services, their commitment and sustainability.<disp-quote

                        invalidated by visiting services that make assumptions of their context and
                        needs. The participants provided examples of how they develop and maintain a

                    <p>As well as the approach of the visiting service, the participants reported
                        the continuity of staff and continuity of brand, demonstration of
                        consistency, and direct efforts to connect with local stakeholders as
                        factors that influence the development of relationship. As an outcome of
                        these strategies, the participants reported that once the relationship has
                        been established and the organisation has demonstrated consistency and
                        commitment to the community, the service is able to tailor the frequency of
                        visits without impacting the strength of relationship. Further, the
                        participants reported that a team approach with an existing relationship
                        allows for the movement of staff when required (e.g., maternity leave,
                        promotion to managerial role, or a reallocation to new region) without

                    <p>In the case of Outback Futures, co&#x02010;design is fundamental to their
                        model of service. The participants explained that the organisation operated
                        purely on an invitation&#x02010;only basis.<disp-quote

                            <p>We won't go into a region unless there's been some level of
                        invitation from the community, and that invitation then leads us to do a

                        welcome and that we are doing what they want us to be doing. <named-content

                            <p>I think the coming together of our expertise with the community's
                        expertise is what actually helped identify the priority because sometimes we

                        spots&#x02026; it's really only as you put them together, and they wrestle
                        together that you actually figure out what the priority is. It's actually a
                        genuine co&#x02010;creation of stuff and having the breadth of voices [from
                        the community] is part of the important bit of that&#x02026; you can get a
                        bit of a biased view dependant on who you listen to. <named-content

                    <p>The participants indicated that to be effective in co&#x02010;design requires
                        flexibility from the visiting service. Specifically for the case,
                        flexibility in funding sources, scope of practice, and in the structure of
                        their workforce with non&#x02010;clinical, community&#x02010;focussed roles.<disp-quote

                            <p>I think the diversity of our funding comes back in again because, if
                        you are just funded by Government, then it's only the procured services that
                        are going to be funded and that's going to determine how much you've got to
                        invest time, and money, and resources and into engagement, or into
                        co&#x02010;design, or into listening. The fact that we have diversity in our
                        funding means that we have more flexibility to invest in the less
                        service&#x02010;orientated aspect of our model. Like the listening and the

                    <title>Being effective as a visiting service is challenging</title>
                    <p>The participants consistently indicated that being an effective visiting
                        service is really challenging. This theme is the broadest of all three
                        themes produces and is related to the previous two separately. Establishing
                        an effective relationship is difficult due to the existing stigma in rural
                        and remote communities and hesitancy to trust visiting services generally.
                        Co&#x02010;design is challenging due to mismatched expectations for what the
                        service will provide, logistical challenges of partnership, and scheduling,
                        as well as the difficulty sourcing a well&#x02010;rounded, unbiased
                        community opinion rather than an individual viewpoint. Further, both
                        developing a reliable relationship and engaging in co&#x02010;design require
                        time and resources that are often not incorporated into funding grants.
                        Outback Futures is a not&#x02010;for&#x02010;profit organisation and
                        currently operates a no&#x02010;fee for service to reduce barriers to
                        engagement. A challenge for the organisation now, having worked in some
                        communities for 5&#x02009;years, is to introduce a fee to enhance the
                        likelihood of long&#x02010;term community engagement with healthcare, beyond
                        visits from OF.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"

                            <p>Part of our challenge at the moment is looking at how do we build
                        that in as part of the model? So that communities are actually valuing what
                        they're getting, because if whoever&#x02010; whether it's Government, or
                        Outback Futures, or another agency give them [clients] free service for
                        5&#x02009;years and later on they're forced to pay for it, if they don't
                        value it enough, they won't be prepared to. <named-content

                    <p>The participants stated that OF is determined to make a long&#x02010;term
                        impact on community well&#x02010;being which involves challenges
                        particularly related to funding.<disp-quote content-type="quotation"

                        make feasibility really difficult but the organisation has committed to just
                        keep trying to fill those buckets [of different funding]. <named-content

                            <p>I think that one of the hard things is that because there's so much
                        turnover&#x02026; keeping on top of who's there, and also keeping on top of
                        exactly what they're doing because part of the justification of what we're
                        doing is because other services aren't doing it. But sometimes they are,
                        sometimes they aren't, because sometimes they can get a speech [speech
                        pathologist] and sometimes they can't, and that can really change with the
                        wind. Sometimes we are doubling up [with other services] and sometimes
                        there's gaping holes. <named-content content-type="attribution">(Participant

                        better? Read it better and sort of have an ongoing iterative process around
                        that evaluation so that we're being constantly informed by how that

            <title>DISCUSSION</title>
            <p>The current research provides evidence for the clinical utility of the revised model
                of seven principles for effective visiting services (the model).<xref
                    rid="ajr12946-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>2</sup>\n</xref>, <xref
                    rid="ajr12946-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>5</sup>\n</xref> A pragmatic
                outcome of the current research is a self&#x02010;assessment tool for the case
                organisation to use as a tool for evaluation. This is an innovative contribution to
                the literature relating to visiting primary care services, also informing the area
                of clinical practice.</p>
            <p>In the case of Outback Futures, the model received unanimous endorsement by the case
                study's participants. The participants reported that the comprehensive approach
                aligned well with their target of improving whole of community wellbeing.<xref
                    rid="ajr12946-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>10</sup>\n</xref> The
                participants requested minor amendments to the existing published definitions of the
                principles Partnership and Review. Further, the participants reported that the case
                of Outback Futures is not representative of typical visiting services. This belief
                may have risen from the discrepancy between different community's expectations and
                OF's success with relationships and co&#x02010;design. One of the many advantages of
                the OF's model is their availability to both community members and other service
                providers. By recruiting to a region, their staff are more available to meet with,
                and discuss matters relating to that region, even when not on the ground in person.
                Further, the multimodal approach with both face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face and
                telehealth interventions also contributes to the continuity of the service. Due to
                the perceived difference between OF and other visiting services, future research is
                required to determine the suitability of the model of seven principles to other
                visiting primary care organisations.</p>
            <p>Currently, no guidelines, standard procedures or recommendations exist to direct the
                evidence&#x02010;based evaluation of visiting primary care services. The product of
                the present study is the first known attempt to establish a tool for evaluation to
                be used by visiting services. Following the support collected for the model, the
                case of Outback Futures was used to inform the development of the
                self&#x02010;assessment tool presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref
                    rid="ajr12946-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. While currently this measure
                is specific to the case, it provides a prototype that could be replicated and
                modified by other services. Due to the variation in visiting primary care services,
                a framework centred on the model provides a consistent solution to be adaptably
                applied to different organisations.</p>
            <p>Three themes were identified from the data collected, and illustrated different
                components of effective visiting service delivery from the perspective of the case.</p>

                <p>The development of a robust relationship can be further enhanced through

                    Declaration is a publication that described ten problems related to current
                    models of mental health and well&#x02010;being in rural areas, and proposed ten
                    solutions. In relation to the present research, the Orange Declaration outlined
                    the problem of urban assumptions and their influence through top&#x02010;down
                    service models, as well as the discrepancy between service provision and
                    population need in rural locations. Solutions proposed by the Orange Declaration
                    include service models tailored to the context of individual communities, and
                    co&#x02010;designed, bottom&#x02010;up processes to generate appropriate

                    The process of co&#x02010;design encourages an increase in capacity,
                    empowerment, resilience and connection as individuals are asked to provide their
                    perspective as experts of their own community and culture.<xref

                    flexibility is found in the diversity of their funding sources that allows them
                    to continue to prioritise community engagement and co&#x02010;design beyond
                    specific grants allocated only to the delivery of services. Co&#x02010;design is
                    a vital component of the effectiveness of Outback Futures as a visiting service.</p>

                <title>Challenge</title>
                <p>From the perspective of the case, being effective as a visiting service
                    organisation is challenging. It is challenging because of the stigma that has
                    developed around visiting services and work required to build trust and rapport.
                    It is challenging because being genuine and committed to co&#x02010;design
                    requires time, resources and flexibility. It is challenging because the
                    literature related to visiting services is sparse and inconsistent and because
                    OF feels different from the typical mould of visiting services. It is
                    challenging because OF's commitment to communities extend beyond what they can
                    grasp in funding, and because valued components of their service are not often
                    included in funding grants (i.e., co&#x02010;design). Further challenges include
                    the turnover of workforce in rural and remote areas<xref rid="ajr12946-bib-0004"
                        ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>4</sup>\n</xref>, <xref rid="ajr12946-bib-0011"

                        ref-type="bibr">\n<sup>12</sup>\n</xref> and the impact this has on the
                    organisation's justification, partnership and scope; internal team logistics
                    scheduling clinics and responding to need. It is challenging to review the
                    service in an evidence&#x02010;based and meaningful way. The challenges reported
                    have not been published in literature relating to visiting services, and could
                    serve as an explanation for the state of the literature, being sparse and
                    inconsistent. This clinical experience is a valuable contribution to the
                    research literature.</p>

                <title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
                <p>This case study provides support for the clinical utility of the revised model of
                    seven principles for effective visiting services, and includes a prototype
                    self&#x02010;assessment tool. The themes identified indicate that the posture
                    adopted by visiting services in rural and remote communities is critical to
                    their effectiveness. It is recommended that visiting services invest sincerely
                    in their relationship with each community, prioritise co&#x02010;design, and
                    adapt their service to the unique needs of the individual communities. The case
                    acknowledges the challenges this involves but indicates the output is of great
                    value to rural and remote residents. A limitation to the application of the
                    prototype self&#x02010;assessment tool is its development with reference to a
                    single case. The case study represents a valuable contribution to the
                    literature; however, further research is required to assess both the clinical
                    utility of the revised model and the applicability of the prototype
                    self&#x02010;assessment tool to other visiting service organisations. The
                    self&#x02010;assessment tool should remain as a prototype until further
                    assessment has been conducted.</p>
