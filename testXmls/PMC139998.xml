                    <p>Allosteric ribozymes (aptazymes) that have extraordinary activation
                        parameters have been generated <italic>in vitro </italic>by design and
                        selection. For example, hammerhead and ligase ribozymes that are activated
                        by small organic effectors and protein effectors have been selected from
                        random sequence pools appended to extant ribozymes. Many ribozymes,
                        especially self-splicing introns, are known control gene regulation or viral
                        replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. We attempted to generate Group I
                        self-splicing introns that were activated by a small organic effector,
                        theophylline, and to show that such Group I aptazymes could mediate
                        theophylline-dependent splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

                        exogenously added small molecules. Substantial differences in gene
                        regulation could be observed with compounds that differed by as little as a
                        single methyl group. The effector-specificity of the Group I aptazyme could
                        be rationally engineered for new effector molecules.</p>

        <sec>
            <title>Background</title>
            <p>Ribozymes whose activities are modulated by effector molecules have previously been
                engineered. For example, Herschlag and co-workers have previously shown that a
                nucleobase could complement an abasic site within the hammerhead ribozyme, restoring
                cleavage activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Similarly, Porta and
                Lizardi engineered a hammerhead ribozyme that assumed an inactive secondary
                structure; upon the addition of an oligonucleotide that disrupted the engineered
                secondary structure, the ribozyme was activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].
                More recently, it has previously been shown that many selected nucleic acid binding
                species (aptamers) undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding [<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] In
                addition, when aptamers are conjoined to ribozymes, the ligand-induced
                conformational changes in the aptamers frequently modulate the structures and hence
                the activities of the ribozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] For example, binding of theophylline to the
                anti-theophylline aptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] modulates the
                conformation of residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the overall stability of the aptamer [<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
                Appending the anti-theophylline aptamer to the hammerhead ribozyme allowed cleavage
                activity to be modulated by 110-fold by theophylline [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, appending the anti-theophylline aptamer to a
                small ribozyme ligase (L1) generated an aptazyme that was activated 1,600-fold by
                saturating theophylline concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
            <p>The methods for engineering and selecting Group I aptazymes appear to be
                generalizable to several different types of ribozymes. Adjoining aptamers to the
                Group I self-splicing intron would potentially allow the control of splicing not
                only <italic>in vitro</italic>, but <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we have
                attempted to generate and assay Group I aptazymes.</p>

                <title>Design of Group I aptazymes</title>
                <p>In order to convert the Group I self-splicing intron to a regulatable aptazyme,
                    it was necessary to first identify sequences or structures in the ribozyme whose
                    conformation might modulate splicing activity. The structural and kinetic
                    properties of the Group I self-splicing intron from the <italic>thymidylate
                    synthase </italic>(<italic>td</italic>) gene in bacteriophage T4 have been
                    extensively studied. In particular, a series of nested deletions of the P6
                    stem-loop have been shown to partially or completely compromise ribozyme
                    activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. More importantly, either
                    magnesium or the tyrosyl tRNA synthetase from Neurospora mitochondria (CYT18)
                    can suppress many of these defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Previous studies with other introns
                    have also revealed that deletion of the P5 stem-loop can modulate ribozyme
                    activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="B19">19</xref>]. We hypothesized that sites where deletions modulated
                    ribozyme activity might also prove to be sites where aptamer conformational
                    changes would modulate ribozyme activity. Based on these studies, we designed a
                    series of Group I aptazymes in which the anti-theophylline aptamer was
                    substituted for either a portion of P6 or P5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig"
                        rid="F1">1</xref>). The anti-theophylline aptamer was attached at the same
                    point as had previously proven successful in the design of
                    theophylline-dependent cleavases and ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>

                <p>The self-splicing activities of the Group I aptazymes were examined <italic>in
                    vitro </italic>using a standard splicing assay (Table <xref ref-type="table"
                        rid="T1">1</xref>). Magnesium had previously been shown to suppress
                    structural defects in the <italic>td </italic>intron, and ligand-induced
                    suppressions of splicing defects were examined by carrying out splicing
                    reactions at either low (3 mM, stringent) or high (8 mM, permissive) magnesium
                    concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several of the
                    constructs were either relatively inactive (e.g., Th3P6, Th5P6, and Th6P6) or
                    did not consistently show differential splicing activity (e.g., Th4P6 and
                    Th2P5). However, four of the constructs, Th1P6, Th2P6, Th3P6, and Th1P5, showed
                    good activity (&#x0003e;10% of wild-type) and increased self-splicing in the
                    presence of theophylline. For example, Th2P6 showed the greatest activation
                    (8-fold at 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), while Th1P5 showed low activation (1.2-fold)
                    at both magnesium concentrations.</p>

                <p>For all of the aptazymes except Th3P6, the ligand-induced splicing activity was
                    greater in a standard assay at the more stringent (3 mM) magnesium concentration
                    (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The construct Th3P6 was
                    inactive at lower magnesium concentrations, but underwent ligand-induced
                    splicing at the more permissive concentration (8 mM). Interestingly, those
                    aptazyme constructs that showed ligand-dependent activity closely resembled the
                    original deletion variants that showed magnesium-dependent recovery of splicing
                    activity. For example, the junction between the aptamer and the Group I ribozyme
                    in the aptazyme Th2P6 resembled the deletion variant <italic>td </italic>&#x00394;P6-6;
                    the aptazyme was activated by theophylline, while the splicing defect of the
                    deletion variant at 3 mM magnesium was suppressed by 8 mM magnesium or by
                    stabilization of a tetraloop sequence that capped the P6 helix [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Defects that poise a ribozyme between
                    active and inactive conformers have previously been used to engineer
                    effector-dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>The kinetics of splicing of two of the most activated variants, Th1P5 and Th2P6,
                    were examined in the presence and absence of theophylline (Figure <xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As in the single point assays, the
                    theophylline-dependence of the engineered introns was readily apparent (Figure <xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The time courses reveal that the extents
                    of splicing of the aptazymes were significantly affected by the addition of
                    theophylline (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,2c</xref>). The aptazyme
                    modified at P5 (Th1P5) showed less theophylline-dependent enhancement of the
                    extent of reaction than the aptazyme modified at P6 (Th2P6), consistent with the
                    single point assays described above. Th1P5 was activated 1.4-fold at 15 minutes
                    (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), while Th2P6 showed a 4.0-fold
                    rate enhancement at 15 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).
                    These levels of ligand-dependent activation were similar to those observed with
                    the original hammerhead aptazyme constructs,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]
                    and it may prove possible to use <italic>in vitro </italic>selection to further

                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, when the time course data
                    were fit with a single exponential equation, the rates of the initial reactions
                    turned out to be very similar in both the presence and absence of theophylline

                <p>Based on these results, the primary mechanism of activation is likely the same as
                    has been observed for other aptazymes: ligand-induced conformational changes
                    that stabilize functional ribozyme sequences and structures. However, the Group
                    I self-splicing intron is a much more complicated ribozyme than either the
                    hammerhead or the L1 ligase; for example, the tertiary structure of the Group I
                    intron is established by a complicated folding pathway. [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                        rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] Therefore, it
                    was possible that theophylline-binding influenced the overall folding pathway of
                    the engineered Group I aptazyme. In order to assess this possibility we examined
                    the theophylline-dependence of Th2P6 splicing reactions <italic>in vitro </italic>following
                    prolonged incubation (30 minutes) to allow for re-folding. No significant change
                    in the extent of ligand-dependent activation was observed following
                    pre-incubation (data not shown). These results argue that both GTP and
                    theophylline may need to be present to influence the folding pathway of the
                    engineered Group I aptazymes. These results are also consistent with previous

                    in rich media were subsequently plated on minimal media lacking thymidine, no
                    colony growth was observed with the exception of Th1P5. However, when
                    theophylline (7.5 mM) was included in the minimal media, bacteria containing the
                    intron Th2P6 formed colonies, and bacteria containing the intron Th1P5 showed
                    increased growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). All introns
                    that originally showed no or low splicing <italic>in vitro </italic>(including
                    Th3P6) could not rescue bacteria either in the presence or absence of
                    theophylline. Finally, no growth was observed in a negative control that
                    contained a non-functional Group I intron (B11), and no theophylline-dependent
                    changes in growth were observed in a negative control in which mutations were
                    introduced into the aptazyme to abolish theophylline binding (Th2P6.D).
                    Interestingly, no growth was observed for bacteria harboring the intron Th1P6,
                    despite the fact that this aptazyme showed the greatest activation by
                    theophylline <italic>in vitro</italic>. The plating results were consistent and

                <p>To better characterize the influence of the effector on intron-splicing, we also
                    carried out a series of growth experiments in liquid culture (Figure <xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). An overnight bacterial culture that
                    contained the <italic>td </italic>gene divided by the aptazyme Th2P6 was
                    inoculated into fresh, minimal media, effector was added, and growth was
                    continuously monitored. As expected based on growth assays on solid media,
                    little growth was observed in the absence of theophylline. However, when
                    theophylline (0.5 mM) was added to liquid medium, bacteria grew almost as well
                    as a control in which the parental intron was inserted into the <italic>td </italic>gene.
                    Most importantly, bacterial growth was not activated by the structurally-related
                    effector caffeine (i.e., 7-methyltheophylline); the anti-theophylline aptamer is
                    known to discriminate between caffeine and theophylline by a factor of
                    10,000-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. No effector-dependent
                    growth differences were observed with cultures containing <italic>td </italic>genes
                    divided by the non-functional Group I intron B11. Similar results were obtained
                    with cultures that contained the <italic>td </italic>gene divided by the
                    aptazyme Th1P5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). However, in
                    this instance there was some background growth of uninduced bacteria, consistent
                    with the higher level of background splicing activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.
                    If theophylline is regulating intron splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>, then the
                    extent of bacterial growth should be dependent upon the concentration of
                    theophylline introduced into the media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>).
                    However, theophylline was toxic to bacteria, and caused a decrease in the growth
                    of bacteria containing the parental <italic>td </italic>intron at concentrations
                    greater than 0.5 mM. Consistent with this observation, low concentrations of
                    theophylline progressively increased bacterial growth (by activating the <italic>
                    td </italic>intron) while concentrations of theophylline above 2 mM
                    progressively decreased bacterial growth (although levels of growth were still
                    well above background).</p>

                <p>These results were all consistent with the hypothesis that theophylline regulates

                <p>Several discrepancies were noted between intron activation <italic>in vitro </italic>and
                    effector-dependent growth. This is not surprising; other studies have revealed
                    that there is often little correlation between ribozyme activity <italic>in

                    However, since it is known that relatively small changes in gene expression can
                    greatly affect the metabolism of an organism, another possible explanation for
                    the apparent discrepancies is that relatively small modulations in intron
                    splicing are amplified via cellular metabolism to yield growth phenotypes. This
                    would seem especially true in the current set of experiments, since the
                    modulation of Thymidylate Synthase expression is known to greatly affect
                    thymidine levels and cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
                    For example, <italic>E. coli </italic>that are starved for thymine quickly die,

                    In this respect, Group I aptazymes that may have yielded lower amounts of
                    functional Thymidylate Synthase (e.g., Th3P6, which was less active than Th2P6;
                    or Th1P6, which mis-spliced) did not allow bacterial growth. In contrast,
                    aptazymes that may have yielded even modestly greater amounts of functional
                    Thymidylate Synthase (e.g., Th1P5, which was both highly active and modestly

                <title>Effector specificity</title>
                <p>In order to examine effector-specificity <italic>in vivo</italic>, a new series
                    of Group I aptazymes was constructed in which the anti-theophylline aptamer was
                    mutated to bind 3-methylxanthine (3MeX2P6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].
                    These variants proved to be responsive to 3-methylxanthine both <italic>in vitro </italic>

                    However, the variants were no longer responsive to theophylline, nor were they
                    responsive to a variety of other analogues, including caffeine,
                    1-methylxanthine, 7-methylxanthine, 1,3-dimethyl urilic acid, hypoxanthine,
                    xanthine, and theobromine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). In
                    contrast, the original aptamer was known to also bind 3-methylxanthine, and the
                    original Group I aptazyme (Th2P6) also proved to be responsive to

                <p>The ability to engineer Group I introns to be responsive to effector molecules
                    has numerous potential applications. For example, it may prove possible to
                    develop new gene therapies in which patients rely upon drugs that can
                    differentially activate gene expression, rather than having to rely upon a set
                    level of endogenous expression of an introduced gene. Similarly, it may prove
                    possible to use effector-dependent splicing to more finely monitor gene
                    expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. A drug could be localized to particular
                    organs, cells, or organelles, and splicing of the aptazyme could be monitored
                    via a reporter gene such as luciferase. It is also possible to imagine that
                    engineered introns introduced into reporter genes may find application in
                    high-throughput, cell-based screening assays that monitor drug uptake or
                    efficacy. These strategies should prove useful not only for self-splicing
                    introns activated by drugs, but for introns activated by proteins or peptides.
                    In this regard, it is notable that some natural Group I introns have proven to
                    be highly dependent upon protein cofactors,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]
                    and that Group I introns have been engineered whose tertiary structure and
                    activity is dependent upon a peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].
                    Such applications could also be melded with other innovations dependent upon the
                    Group I self-splicing intron, such as the introduction of a trans-splicing
                    intron that can potentially repair or modulate the expression of a given mRNA. [<xref

            <p>Group I aptazymes that were dependent upon theophylline both <italic>in vitro </italic>
                and <italic>in vivo </italic>were engineered by conjoining the <italic>thymidylate
                synthase </italic>(<italic>td</italic>) intron with an anti-theophylline aptamer.
                Although the <italic>in vitro </italic>activation of splicing was modest (up to an
                18-fold change in initial rate), this change was more than enough to mediate the
                survival of a thymidine-dependent <italic>E. coli </italic>strain. The ligand
                specificity of the anti-theophylline aptamer carried over to the
                theophylline-dependent aptazyme, and no activation was seen with caffeine, which
                differed by a single methyl group from theophylline. The effector specificity could
                be rationally changed by changing the specificity of the conjoined aptamer: when a
                mutation was introduced into the anti-theophylline aptamer that led to
                discrimination against theophylline and in favor of 3-methylxanthine (that also
                differed from theophylline by a single methyl group), the aptamer became solely
                responsive to 3-methylxanthine <italic>in vivo</italic>. Group I aptazymes may have
                a number of important biotechnology applications, including use as <italic>in vivo</italic>,

                <p>The wild type plasmid pTZtd1304 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]
                    contains a fully functional 265 nt derivative of the 1016 nt wild type intron [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This derivative also contains the
                    substitutions U34A, which introduces a SpeI site, and U976G, which introduces an
                    EcoRI site. The constructs were made using standard solid phase DNA synthesis,
                    then were PCR-amplified and cloned into pTZtd1304. The parental P6 aptazyme
                    construct was generated by two overlapping oligos, Gp1Wt2 Gp1Wt2.122 (GCC TGA

                    extended with AMV reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,
                    NJ; 45 units) in AMV RT buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,

                    The resulting double-stranded DNA was diluted 1:50 and amplified using primers
                    SpeI.24 (TTA TAC TAG TAA TCT ATC TAA ACG; 0.4 &#x003bc;M) and EcoRI.24 (CCC GGA

                    (200 &#x003bc;M) and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI; 1.5 units). The
                    reactions were thermocycled 15 times at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds,
                    45&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute and then purified with a
                    QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR product was
                    digested with SpeI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; 20 units) and EcoRI (50
                    units) in buffer (50 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,

                    reaction (100 &#x003bc;l) and cycled 15 times; DNA was purified using a QIAquick

                <p>The assays were performed by heating the RNA (500 nM) in H<sub>2</sub>O to
                    70&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes then transferring to ice for 1 minute. Splicing
                    buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), effector
                    (theophylline, 1.5 mM) was added and the reactions were incubated on ice for an
                    additional 15 minutes. At this time a 4.5 &#x003bc;l aliquot was removed for a
                    zero time point and quenched with 5 &#x003bc;l stop dye (95% formamide, 20 mM
                    EDTA, 0.5% xylene cyanol, and 0.5% bromophenol blue). GTP (50 &#x003bc;M) was
                    added to the remaining reaction (5 &#x003bc;l total volume) to start the
                    splicing reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes and
                    then terminated with stop dye (5 &#x003bc;l). The reactions were heated to
                    70&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes and 5 &#x003bc;l was analyzed on a 8% denaturing
                    polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, exposed to a phosphor screen and analyzed
                    using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager (Sunnyvale, CA).</p>
                <p>The reaction volumes were increased for the rate determination assay. Aliquots
                    were taken at intervals between 0 minutes and 15 minutes and terminated with
                    stop dye. The reactions were analyzed as described above. For each time point,
                    the number of counts in unreacted intron, spliced intron, and circularized
                    intron were determined. Background counts were subtracted from these values. The
                    fraction of reacted intron was then calculated as:</p>
                <p>
                    <italic>(circular intron + spliced intron) / (unreacted intron + circular intron
                        + spliced intron)</italic>
                </p>
                <p>The individual time points were averaged together, the fraction reacted was
                    plotted versus time, and rate constants were extracted by fitting the data to a
                    single-exponential equation:</p>

                    )</sup></p>
                <p>The plotted data and rate constants for Th1P5 and Th2P6 constructs are shown in
                    Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig"
                        rid="F2">2c</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The
                    changes in the extent of reaction observed between individual experiments, and
                    thus the attendant error bars, were consistent with those observed during the
                    kinetic analyses of other ribozymes. For example, studies of the hairpin
                    ribozyme have shown that data points can vary between individual experiments by
                    as much as 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our data points
                    typically varied from one another by less than 30%.</p>
